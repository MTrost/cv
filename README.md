# Todo

- Correct texts
- Link to Github & Twitter
- Info text (on pdf only) how the pdf was generated and where to find the website
- Info text (on website only) how the site was built
- Refactor toPdf.js to TypeScript
- Optimize static assets and serve them over CDN
- Fix: InterSection Observer behaves weirdly on last element

# Nice to have

- Integrate smallpdf (https://smallpdf.com) or similar service to optimize pdf output
- GUI (incl. preview?) to generate & download pdf on remote server
